### What is the purpose of this app?
The purpose of this application it's to visualize the most important path-finding algorithms that are used everyday. The algorithms you can visualize are: Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm and A* Algorithm (using Manhattan Distance formule to calculate the distance).

### How to use the app?
This app its easy to use if you are doing something wrong an alert will pop up to tell what are you doing wrong.

### Path colors
There are five colors that alternate between eachother. The faded colors represents blocks that will be visited, and the solid ones represent the blocks that have been visited, or the path from point A to point B (if they have no borders).

### Checkpoints
You can place checkpoints between the start/stop point, every algorithm will go to the nearest checkpoint, then to the stop point. You can place as many checkpoints as you want.
